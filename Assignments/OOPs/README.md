---

## High Level Overview

### Login In and Sign Up

1. The system should be accessed via a CLI (Command Line Interface)
2. It should consist of a Passenger "Login" (List the Passengers / Admin)
3. A login (applicable for both passenger and admin) should consist of a unique username/id. Enabling security measures (like passwords) is optional
4. A new user should also be able to sign up into the system and provide valid (non-empty) Name, Username and Password

### What should a Passenger(P) be able to do

- Book a Ticket from between 2 locations say (A and B) on a desired date
- A booking can only result in a single ticket being booked
- Upon a booking a ticket, P should be assigned a ticket containing a Seat and Coach Number
- Upon booking the ticket the User should be made aware of the cost of the Ticket (could be calculated from either the Euclidean or Manhattan distance of the two locations)
- Between Two Locations, on a given date, there is a single train going between them
- Each Train has only 2 Coaches with 4 seats on each coach
- No two passengers can have the same (start_location, end_location, date, coach, seat) value
- A passenger should not be allowed to book a ticket on the same date
- If a train is full, the passenger should immediately be notified that they have not been alloted a ticket and cannot do so

## Low Level Overview

- Choose appropriate access specifiers (public, private and protected) for the various attributes
- Given below are the class diagrams for the classes that you have to implement
- Do not restrict yourself to these, they are just to get you started and help you get an idea
